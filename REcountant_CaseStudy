Describe the project (including the name of the product) and the goals of the project.
• Present a logo and tagline if you have such.
• Name and explain your role in the project.
• List the deliverables you produced.
• Break your work into sections (research, problem statement, ideation, prototype development, etc.) and describe work in those sections.
• Along with descriptions of work, you should share visuals to help the reader understand the work of each section. If you care to, you can also share design guidelines your team followed.
• Be sure to provide visual examples of your product, with explanations of design decisions made along the way.
• I assume you will have a clickable prototype to also link to in your case study, or a movie of the app being used to demonstrate some of the features and functions.
